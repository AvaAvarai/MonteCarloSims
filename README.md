# MonteCarloSims

Monte-Carlo simulations of:

### Pi convergence:

- Sample a circular space and approximate Pi.
- Compare results under different amounts of samples.

### Particle simulations:

- Observe circular vs orthogonal particle simulation regions.
- Transfer "energy" represented as color from cold (blue) to hot (red) between particles during collision.
